      <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Adrian, welcome to my site.</p>
      <p>I am a technical marketer based in the Boston area. I currently run marketing for <a href="https://dockwa.com">Dockwa</a>.</p>
      <p>If you haven't head of Dockwa, we make software that connects boaters and marinas, enabling boaters to spend more time boating and marinas to spend less time on paperwork.</p>
      <p>Before Dockwa, I co-founded Bedrock Data, a data integration platform which was recently acquired by Formstack.<p>
      <p>Even before that(!) I spent a few years at Black Duck Software and then HubSpot.</p>
      <p>Originally from Western Mass and Maine. I live on Boston's North Shore with my family.</p>
